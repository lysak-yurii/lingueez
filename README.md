# Lingueez

A desktop app for building, studying, and remembering vocabulary across languages.

Add words and they translate automatically; listen to them on repeat and watch each
one climb from *New* to *Mastered* as you do; read whole texts with side-by-side
translations and synced audio; and keep everything in sync across devices.

## Features

- **Words** — add, edit, and organize entries with statuses, favorites, tags, and
  two definition fields.
- **Learning progression** — words advance *New → Reviewing → Learning → Mastered*
  as you listen, with configurable listen thresholds.
- **Search & filters** — live search across words, translations, and tags; filter by
  language, status, tag, or favorites.
- **Translation** — Google Translate, with optional DeepL integration.
- **AI assistance** — OpenAI or Gemini for definitions and generated study texts.
- **Audio** — read-aloud with adjustable pauses and repeats, MP3
  export, and a floating mini-player when the window is minimized.
- **Texts reader** — import from files, the web, Wikipedia, or RSS; read with a
  side-by-side translation and word highlighting synced to playback
  ([screenshot](screenshots/texts.png)).
- **Statistics** — a dashboard with status distribution, streaks, definition
  coverage, and progress over time ([screenshot](screenshots/statistics.png)).
- **Import & export** — Excel import with duplicate detection; export to PDF, Excel,
  CSV, and **Anki**-friendly TXT.
- **Sync & backups** — two-way cloud sync, a bin to restore deleted items, and
  automatic daily backups with retention.
- **System integration** — tray icon, autostart on login, and a global hotkey to add a word straight from the clipboard.

API keys and preferences are all managed inside the app under **Settings**.

## Keyboard shortcut

A global hotkey (**Ctrl+Shift+V** by default, configurable in **Settings**) adds a
word straight from the clipboard and translates it.
