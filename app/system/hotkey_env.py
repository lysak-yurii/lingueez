"""Capability detection for the global Add-Word hotkey.

The hotkey is registered differently per environment (Windows ``keyboard`` lib,
X11 pynput agent, Wayland GlobalShortcuts portal, or a GNOME gsettings keybinding
on pre-portal Wayland). Some environments simply cannot register a global hotkey,
and the right answer is to tell the user *why* and *how to fix it* rather than fail
silently. This module answers one question — :func:`hotkey_capability` — by probing
*capabilities* (is a portal present? are we sandboxed?) rather than sniffing desktop
versions, which is brittle across compositors and derivatives.

Pure logic only: it returns machine-readable reason keys, never user-facing text,
so the UI layer owns localization.
